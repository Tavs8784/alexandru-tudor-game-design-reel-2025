# Game Design Reel — Unity (2025)

**What this is:** Three tiny, self-contained slices that demonstrate level/system design:
- **Level 1 – Navigate (“Find the Beacon”):** sightlines, landmarks, soft-gate, pacing.
- **Level 2 – Place (“Rules-Based Arrangement”):** adjacency rules, instant feedback.
- **Onboarding Slice:** teaching the core verb without text walls.
