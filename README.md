# Game Design Reel — Unity (2025)

**What this is:** Three tiny, self-contained slices that demonstrate level/system design:
- **Level 1 – Navigate (“Find the Beacon”):** sightlines, landmarks, soft-gate, pacing.
- **Level 2 – Place (“Rules-Based Arrangement”):** adjacency rules, instant feedback.
- **Onboarding Slice:** teaching the core verb without text walls.

## Watch the annotated clips
- Level 1 (90s): Captures/level_navigate_annotated.mp4
- Level 2 (90s): Captures/level_place_annotated.mp4
- Onboarding (60–90s): Captures/onboarding_slice.mp4

## Play it

- Controls: WASD/Left Stick to move, Mouse/Right Stick to look, E/Interact.

## Design evidence (not just vibes)
- `Artifacts/*.csv` — event logs and path samples used for pacing/heatmaps.
- `Docs/*` — one-pagers (pacing graphs, readability maps, iteration notes).

## Tech
Unity 2022.3 LTS (URP). ProBuilder blockouts, simple C# triggers, lightweight VFX for readability.
